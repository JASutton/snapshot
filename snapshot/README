This application has been built to demonstrate the learning,
coding, and design capabilities of its author, Jordan Sutton. This project uses open-source services written and hosted by Jason Watmore.

The app uses AngularJS to implement a simple, secure method of registration and sign-in to be connected to a RESTful server-side user management system.

In addition, an incomplete draft of a component to implement a scalable image gallery has been included.

New pages can be added to the application easily in app.js, with subsequent content and business logic organized into folders following the naming convention established herein.
